# PyData Cardiff Meetups

## About us

PyData Cardiff is the Cardiff chapter of the international PyData community.

PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R.

PyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. The PyData Code of Conduct (http://pydata.org/code-of-conduct.html) governs this meetup. To discuss any issues or concerns relating to the code of conduct or the behavior of anyone at a PyData meetup, please contact NumFOCUS Executive Director Leah Silen (+1 512-222-5449; leah@numfocus.org) or the group organiser.
